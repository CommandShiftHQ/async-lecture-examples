# Async Lecture Examples

This material accompanies the **Working with asynchronous Javascript** lecture.

## How to use

Clone and `npm install`

Examples can be run from the command line by doing:

```
node src/lecture-1/1-synchronous.js
```

Lecture 1 examples live in `src/lecture-1` and referenced in the slides

Lecture 2 examples live in `src/lecture-2` and referenced in the slides

## Requirements

Written using `node@v10.15.1`. Cannot garantee `async/await` (`readFilesAsyncAwait` and `fetchAsyncAwait`) will work in previous versions of node.
